Using Node
Node Js helps to librate the javascript to work outside the browser.

first we import the require module to our js file and then we have called readFile and writeFile to 
manipute our file system porvided by node js.

NPM Package Manager and installing external Package
the first step is to initialize the NPM package using 'npn init' keyword and it will create a configuration file for
us. Then we can go npm website and can install external packages. these are like a toolkit in our project to reduce the
workload.

In our config or json file we can add 'type : module' rather a common js. It helps to use the import keyword rather typing
require for using the package. This is the way to follow ECMA script.
